# Cursor Rules for your Next.js project
project_style:
  language: "TypeScript + React (Next.js App Router)"

    - "src/app (App Router)"
    - "src/components"
    - "src/lib"
    - "src/styles"

  alias: "@/*"
  patterns:
    - "Small, reusable components when possible"
    - "Strong typing for props and functions (no 'any')"
    - "Responsive-first, mobile-first design"
    - "Accessibility: proper heading hierarchy, alt text, aria-labels"
    - "Use cn() util (clsx + tailwind-merge) for classNames"
    - "Prefer @/* alias over long relative paths"

practices:
  performance:
    - "Prevent unnecessary re-renders: React.memo/useCallback where reasonable"
    - "Lazy-load images with loading='lazy'"
  accessibility:
    - "Correct heading levels (h1 once per page)"
    - "Icon-only buttons must have aria-label"

deliverables:
  - "Always produce running code (no pseudo-code)"
  - "If CLI steps are needed, list the exact commands to run"
  - "Group file changes by topic for easier review"
